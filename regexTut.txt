for questions:
we won't use /\n[0-1]+/
instead use /\n[0-9][0-9]+\./
why? couse there can be 1. 2. 3. for one question. it has to be more than 2. most questions don't have that many counting things in UNEC. 
(if we could have it in something like excel, we wouldn't need to carry about regex and "most questions" but as we only have those, we need to) 
replace question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 so they'll match the regex.
don't put a new line at the top of the first question. # splits, so we shouldn't even use it for first question. 
(like cutting from the second's start will give us first, but cutting from first's start will give us nothing)
select all regexes and replace with \n#


then for answers:
\n•
replace with \n-

for correct answers:
\n√
replace with:
\n+
